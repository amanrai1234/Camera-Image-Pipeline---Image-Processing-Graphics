# De_Bayering

I have created two files
1]camera_signal_processing- for running the program using.py file
2]googlecollab.ipynb - this file is self contained and can be run directly on google collab in case there are any issues with the running of the first file

I have used the libraries:
rawpy,copy, PIL, numpy, matplotlib.pypllot, cv2, math

I have saved_image which is the result of the image
